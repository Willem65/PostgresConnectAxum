<h1><a name="S4.18.1"></a>4.18.1 <a name="i0"></a>Key exchange algorithm selection</h1>
<p>
PuTTY supports a variety of SSH-2 key exchange methods, and allows you to choose which one you prefer to use; configuration is similar to cipher selection (see <a href="config-ssh-encryption.html#S4.20">section 4.20</a>).
</p>
<p>
PuTTY currently supports the following key exchange methods:
</p>
<ul><li>
&#8216;NTRU Prime / Curve25519 hybrid&#8217;: &#8216;<a name="i1"></a>Streamlined NTRU Prime&#8217; is a lattice-based algorithm intended to resist <a name="i2"></a>quantum attacks. In this key exchange method, it is run in parallel with a conventional Curve25519-based method (one of those included in &#8216;ECDH&#8217;), in such a way that it should be no <em>less</em> secure than that commonly-used method, and hopefully also resistant to a new class of attacks.
</li>
<li>
&#8216;<a name="i3"></a>ECDH&#8217;: elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange, with a variety of standard curves and hash algorithms.
</li>
<li>
The original form of <a name="i4"></a>Diffie-Hellman key exchange, with a variety of well-known groups and hashes:
<ul><li>
&#8216;Group 18&#8217;, a well-known 8192-bit group, used with the SHA-512 hash function.
</li>
<li>
&#8216;Group 17&#8217;, a well-known 6144-bit group, used with the SHA-512 hash function.
</li>
<li>
&#8216;Group 16&#8217;, a well-known 4096-bit group, used with the SHA-512 hash function.
</li>
<li>
&#8216;Group 15&#8217;, a well-known 3072-bit group, used with the SHA-512 hash function.
</li>
<li>
&#8216;Group 14&#8217;: a well-known 2048-bit group, used with the SHA-256 hash function or, if the server doesn't support that, SHA-1.
</li>
<li>
&#8216;Group 1&#8217;: a well-known 1024-bit group, used with the SHA-1 hash function. Neither we nor current SSH standards recommend using this method any longer, and it's not used by default in new installations; however, it may be the only method supported by very old server software. 
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
&#8216;Diffie-Hellman <a name="i5"></a>group exchange&#8217;: with this method, instead of using a fixed group, PuTTY requests that the server suggest a group to use for a subsequent Diffie-Hellman key exchange; the server can avoid groups known to be weak, and possibly invent new ones over time, without any changes required to PuTTY's configuration. This key exchange method uses the SHA-256 hash or, if the server doesn't support that, SHA-1.
</li>
<li>
&#8216;<a name="i6"></a>RSA-based key exchange&#8217;: this requires much less computational effort on the part of the client, and somewhat less on the part of the server, than Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
</li>
<li>
&#8216;GSSAPI key exchange&#8217;: see <a href="config-ssh-gssapi-kex.html#S4.18.1.1">section 4.18.1.1</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the first algorithm PuTTY finds is below the &#8216;warn below here&#8217; line, you will see a warning box when you make the connection, similar to that for cipher selection (see <a href="config-ssh-encryption.html#S4.20">section 4.20</a>).
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="config-ssh-gssapi-kex.html#S4.18.1.1">4.18.1.1 GSSAPI-based key exchange</a></li>
</ul>
