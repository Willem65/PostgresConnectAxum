<h1><a name="S4.22.3"></a>4.22.3 &#8216;<a name="i0"></a>Plugin to provide authentication responses&#8217;</h1>
<p>
An SSH server can use the &#8216;keyboard-interactive&#8217; protocol to present a series of arbitrary questions and answers. Sometimes this is used for ordinary passwords, but sometimes the server will use the same mechanism for something more complicated, such as a one-time password system.
</p>
<p>
Some of these systems can be automated. For this purpose, PuTTY allows you to provide a separate program to act as a &#8216;plugin&#8217; which will take over the authentication and send answers to the questions on your behalf.
</p>
<p>
If you have been provided with a plugin of this type, you can configure it here, by entering a full command line in the &#8216;Plugin command to run&#8217; box.
</p>
<p>
(If you want to <em>write</em> a plugin of this type, see <a href="authplugin.html#AH">appendix H</a> for the full specification of how the plugin is expected to behave.)
