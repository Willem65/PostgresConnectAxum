<h1><a name="S9.2.1"></a>9.2.1 The key list box</h1>
<p>
The large list box in the Pageant main window lists the private keys that are currently loaded into Pageant. The list might look something like this:
</p>
<pre><code>Ed25519    SHA256:TddlQk20DVs4LRcAsIfDN9pInKpY06D+h4kSHwWAj4w
RSA  2048  SHA256:8DFtyHm3kQihgy52nzX96qMcEVOq7/yJmmwQQhBWYFg
</code></pre>
<p>
For each key, the list box will tell you:
</p>
<ul><li>
The type of the key. Currently, this can be &#8216;RSA&#8217; (an RSA key for use with the SSH-2 protocol), &#8216;DSA&#8217; (a DSA key for use with the SSH-2 protocol), &#8216;<a name="i0"></a>NIST&#8217; (an ECDSA key for use with the SSH-2 protocol), &#8216;Ed25519&#8217; (an Ed25519 key for use with the SSH-2 protocol), &#8216;Ed448&#8217; (an Ed448 key for use with the SSH-2 protocol), or &#8216;SSH-1&#8217; (an RSA key for use with the old SSH-1 protocol). (If the key has an associated certificate, this is shown here with a &#8216;cert&#8217; suffix.)
</li>
<li>
The size (in bits) of the key, for key types that come in different sizes. (For ECDSA &#8216;NIST&#8217; keys, this is indicated as &#8216;p256&#8217; or &#8216;p384&#8217; or &#8216;p521&#8217;.)
</li>
<li>
The <a name="i1"></a>fingerprint for the public key. This should be the same fingerprint given by PuTTYgen, and (hopefully) also the same fingerprint shown by remote utilities such as <a name="i2"></a><code>ssh-keygen</code> when applied to your <code>authorized_keys</code> file.
<p>
For SSH-2 keys, by default this is shown in the &#8216;SHA256&#8217; format. You can change to the older &#8216;MD5&#8217; format (which looks like <code>aa:bb:cc:...</code>) with the &#8216;Fingerprint type&#8217; drop-down, but bear in mind that this format is less secure and should be avoided for comparison purposes where possible.
</p>
<p>
If some of the keys loaded into Pageant have certificates attached, then Pageant will default to showing the fingerprint of the underlying key. This way, a certified and uncertified version of the same key will have the same fingerprint, so you can see that they match. You can instead use the &#8216;Fingerprint type&#8217; drop-down to ask for a different fingerprint to be shown for certified keys, which includes the certificate as part of the fingerprinted data. That way you can tell two certificates apart. 
</p>

</li>
<li>
The comment attached to the key.
</li>
<li>
The state of deferred decryption, if enabled for this key. See <a href="pageant-deferred-decryption.html#S9.5">section 9.5</a>.
</li>
</ul>
